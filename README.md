# Goal

Create some code that can run anywhere (Windows/WSL, Linux, or Mac/OSX)
that demonstrates Gen-AI related skills/capabilities we need in
order to develop GenAI Apps.

# Directories

## backlog
The backlog has a directory for blueprints that might be useful to have.

Each dir has a README explaining the goals of the blueprint.

# Naming convention is General-to-Specific
Some named examples:
- infra-aws-bastion-host
- infra-aws-env-sagemaker-with-nemo
- infra-linux-ssh
- language-python-boiler-plate-app
- language-python-config-via-hydra

## examples
Examples are meant to demonstrate small, independent concepts
and bits of functionality.

## projects
Projects collect complex tasks, like:
- setting up some infrastucture for our dev/test work
  AND adding the code that deploys and runs apps in it.
