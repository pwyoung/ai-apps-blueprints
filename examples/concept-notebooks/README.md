# GOAL

Explain and demonstrate why people use "Notebooks"

# Background

Notebooks capture a product of work, similarly to how
git and docker/containers capture a unit of work.

While containers allow code to be deployed in a repeatable way,
solving the problem:
  "well it works for me".

Notebooks solve a few problems, such as:
  "I didn't get that data result".

Notebooks also can solve the problem:
  "How do I get connected to the tools and data needed to do my work?".

# Background

Notebook Servers are web servers configured to connect to compute and data resources
needed to do ai/ml "data science" work.

Notebooks are data files. They are simple markup (data) files.
Notebook mark-up sections include:
- code blocks (which run code in an interpeter)
- result blocks (which capture the result of code blocks)
- commands (e.g. to switch interpreters)

# TODO
Add some code (or links to code) to run:
- Jupyter (Notebook)
- AWS SageMaker (Notebook)
- Azure and/or AWS DataBricks (Notebook)
