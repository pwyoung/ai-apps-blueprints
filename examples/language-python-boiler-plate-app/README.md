# GOAL

Create an example Python code set that shows how to:
- Run everything with one command (via Make and/or run.sh)
- Easily (and optionally) setup and use a Python virtual environment
- Optionally
  - Include Pythonic ways to manage:
    - Config
    - Logging
    - Testing
    - Linting
    - etc (add more here)

Any app/module should be able to "just work" with a single command.
It's almost always possible to avoid relying on documentation when
automation will work instead.

# WHAT THIS DOES

Demonstrate a simple pattern that supports:
- Running in Python virtual environment
- Ease of use via "make" or "run"
