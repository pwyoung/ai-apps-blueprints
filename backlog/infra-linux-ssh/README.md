# TODO
Add some docs/examples to show people
how to use SSH properly/securely.

Address:
- Using encrypted private keys
- Use SSH credential forwarding
  - to avoid duplicating keys
- Using ~/.ssh/config
  - to make life easy
- Using ssh port forwarding
  - so that we can access anything via SSH, consistently
